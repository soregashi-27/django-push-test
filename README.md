## !! Attention !!
### You don't push 'env directory'.

This project of 'env directory' means vitural environment, because this is created locally.
Then, I only manage source code.

### Create virtual environment

```
$ python -m venv nameToSomething

```

Activating virtual environment

```
$ source nameToSomething/bin/activate

```

Deactivating virtual environment

```
$ deactivate

```
